This is a basic shopping cart application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add products to their cart, view them on the cart page, and remove items if they wish.

## 🚀 Features

- Add products to the cart
- View cart items on a separate page
- Remove products from the cart

## 🗂️ Project Structure

📁 project-folder/
├── index.html # Main page with product listings
├── sepet.html # Cart page to display selected items
├── style.css # CSS file for styling
├── scripts.js # JavaScript logic
└── README.md # Project description file

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## 💡 How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on the **Add to Cart** buttons to select products.
3. Navigate to the cart page (`sepet.html`) to see your cart.
4. Click on **Remove** to delete an item from the cart.

## 💾 Data Persistence

- The cart uses `localStorage` to keep data even when the page is refreshed.
- You can remove individual items without affecting others.

This project was created for learning and practicing basic front-end development skills.
